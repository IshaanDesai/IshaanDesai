## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Stuttgart and the [Cluster of Excellence SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and I am advised by [Benjamin Uekermann](https://github.com/uekerman). I am a scienfitic software developer in the [preCICE project](https://github.com/precice). My educational background is in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science and I mainly work in writing tools and methodologies for simulation software. 

I believe in the [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) philosophy and actively support movements like [Public Money Public Code](https://publiccode.eu/).
