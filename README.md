## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a research associate at the University of Stuttgart and a doctoral candidate at the [Cluster of Excellence SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/). My doctoral supervisor is [Benjamin Uekermann](https://github.com/uekerman). I am a scienfitic software developer in the [preCICE project](https://github.com/precice) where I maintain and develop several repositories. My educational background is in mechanical engineering and computational science. I work in the SimTech research projects [PN5-9](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/research/pn/pn5/pn5-9/) and [PN5-9(II)](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/research/pn/pn5/pn5-9ii/), in which I develop software for multiscale coupled simulations.
